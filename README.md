# jeevesaver
A little script I wrote to archive SmackJeeves.com, which can also be used for any other site.

To run:
* You will need a file called `urlist` containing a list of every URL to be archived in the same directory as `archiver2.sh` and `archiver3.py`
* You will need `bash` and `python3` installed. Unix-like operating systems come with these as standard
* You will need the `savepagenow` Python library, available via `pip`

Simply execute `archiver2.sh` to automatically archive every page in `urlist`
